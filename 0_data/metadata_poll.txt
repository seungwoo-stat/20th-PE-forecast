Among more than 400 polls conducted during the last 100 days of the presidential election,
we removed polls having small survey population. 
For example, survey #9099 only surveyed people living in Jeju-do, although we need samples from
both Jeju-do and Gangwon-do (GJJ cluster).

However, we merged some polls that were conducted by the same house, on the same date, with same method.
For example, if Busan, Ulsan, and Gyeongsangnam-do surveys were conducted separately on the
same date, method, and house, we merged them according to the population weights announed by the
Ministry of the Interior and Safety of Korea. Below, we provide survey numbers that we merged.

list of merged polls:
- 8578 and 8579
- 8694 and 8695
- 8765 and 8766
- 8866 and 8867
- 8999, 9001, and 9003

Note that response rates are not accurate for merged polls. 
(one can easily calculate accurate resp.rates, but we did not since we didn't use them for our analysis.)
